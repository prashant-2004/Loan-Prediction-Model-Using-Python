# Loan-Prediction-Model-Using-Python

To run this model, you need to be installed with python and its path setup with cmd
I had attached the requirements.txt files which contains all libraries need to be install to run the model successfully.
You have to go to this "Loan-Prediction-Model-Using-Python" folder on cmd if you are downloading zip file. 
then, type cmd " pip install requirements.txt " - This will install all libraries into the Python,
If you are using Pycharm, then, you have to install the libraries manually from 'file->settings' menu in pycharm which I am specifying below.

Python Libraries used in this Project â€“ 
1.	Pandas- pip install pandas
2.	NumPy- pip install numpy
3.	Matplotlib- pip install matplotlib
4.	Scikit-learn- pip install scikit-learn

This model gives you a output in array of 1 & 0 which indicates the yes or no for loan assigning.

I had attached the .pdf which explains all about the Model with the steps which are need to be follow while making model code.
